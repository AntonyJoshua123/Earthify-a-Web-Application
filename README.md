Problem Statement: The world faces an environmental crisis, with 2024 being the hottest year on
record due to global warming. Deforestation, plastic pollution, and
unsustainable consumption are accelerating climate change, yet young people
lack practical tools to take action. Schools and communities often fail to provide
engaging, hands-on ways to learn about sustainability, leaving kids
disconnected and unsure how to help. Bridging this gap is essential to
empowering the next generation to combat climate change and build a
sustainable future.

Solution: 
Earthify is an interactive web platform that empowers kids and teens (12-18) to
take real action against climate change through daily eco-friendly tasks, DIY
projects, and a gamified Earth restoration system. Users earn virtual points by
completing tasks that contribute to a healthier virtual Earth. Beyond the virtual
world, Earthify creates real-world impact by partnering with NGOs to translate
user actions into tangible environmental benefits, such as planting real trees,
organizing clean-up drives, and supporting sustainable initiatives. By
combining education, engagement, and real-world action, Earthify inspires the
next generation to build a greener future, one task at a time. üåç‚ú®
