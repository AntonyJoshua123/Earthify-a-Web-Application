                <p><b>Task:</b> Create your very own plant pot using old things you can find around the house, like plastic bottles, tin cans, or even coconut shells. Then, plant a special air-purifying plant in it! 🌱</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Look for plants like Aloe Vera, Snake Plant, and Peace Lily. These plants are superheroes that clean the air for us! 🦸‍♂️🌿</p>
